# glmExtras

This package contains extra functions that are useful when working with generalized linear models

## Installation

Currently there isn't a release on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/).

You can, however, download the [zip ball](https://github.com/Dasonk/glmExtras/zipball/master) or [tar ball](https://github.com/Dasonk/glmExtras/tarball/master), decompress and run `R CMD INSTALL` on it, or use the **devtools** package to install the development version:

```r
## Make sure your current packages are up to date
update.packages()
## devtools is required
library(devtools)
install_github("glmExtras", "Dasonk")
```

Note: Windows users need [Rtools](http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/) to install this way.
